# MobileNet

### Purpose
- This repository is the very first code implementation of deep learning model using **PyTorch**. I wanted to grow my fluency in PyTorch as much as I have for Tensorflow.

## Train result
- Training result on CIFAR10
- Somehow I couldn't verify the efficiency of MobileNet in training speed, when compared with vanilla CNN counterpart
